The focus lied on using tropical geometry to analyze Morphological Neural Networks, studying the sparsity of their representations compared to their linear counterparts, their ability to enforce shape constraints such as monotonicity, and extending a training algorithm based on Difference-of-Convex Programming to multiclass problems.\nI am also an avid classical guitar player!

Our approach utilizes ideas from tropical geometry and mathematical morphology. First, we state the training of a binary morphological classifier as a Difference-of-Convex optimization problem and extend this method to multiclass tasks. We then focus on general  morphological networks trained with gradient descent variants and show, quantitatively via pruning schemes as well as qualitatively, the sparsity of the resulted representations compared to FeedForward networks with ReLU activations as well as the effect the raining optimizer has on such compression techniques. Finally, we show how  morphological networks can be employed to guarantee monotonicity and present a softened version of a known architecture, based on Maslov Dequantization, which alleviates issues of gradient propagation associated with its “hard” counterparts and moderately improves performance.","tags":["Tropical Geometry","Morphological Neural Networks","Monotonicity","Pruning","Maslov Dequantization"],"title":"Advances in morphological neural networks: training, pruning and enforcing shape constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaos Dimitriadis","Petros Maragos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605472990,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605472990,"objectID":"af5b3c94a2694ea729dd1076ddf37afa","permalink":"https://nik-dim.github.io/publication/arxiv2021/","publishdate":"2020-11-15T20:43:10.986Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we study an emerging class of neural networks based on the morphological operators of dilation and erosion. We explore these networks mathematically from a tropical geometry perspective as well as mathematical morphology. Our contributions are threefold. First, we examine the training of morphological networks via Difference-of-Convex programming methods and extend a binary morphological classifier to multiclass tasks. Second, we focus on the sparsity of dense morphological networks trained via gradient descent algorithms and compare their performance to their linear counterparts under heavy pruning, showing that the morphological networks cope far better and are characterized with superior compression capabilities. Our approach incorporates the effect of the training optimizer used and offers quantitative and qualitative explanations. Finally, we study how the architectural structure of a morphological network can affect shape constraints, focusing on monotonicity. Via Maslov Dequantization, we obtain a softened version of a known architecture and show how this approach can improve training convergence and performance.","tags":null,"title":"Advances in the training, pruning and enforcement of shape constraints of Morphological Neural Networks using Tropical Algebra","type":"publication"}]
